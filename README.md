## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a Rocket web framework skeleton that you can work with.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement a feature: `Notification`.
This feature will receive notifications of creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, when this receiver instance is subscribed to a certain product type.
The notification will be sent using HTTP POST request, so you need to make the receiver endpoint in this project.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Receiver" folder.

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    ROCKET_PORT=8001
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:${ROCKET_PORT}
    APP_PUBLISHER_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8000
    APP_INSTANCE_NAME=Safira Sudrajat
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable                | type   | description                                                     |
    |-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ROCKET_PORT             | string | Port number that will be listened by this receiver instance.    |
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL   | string | URL address where this receiver instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_PUUBLISHER_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where the publisher instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_INSTANCE_NAME       | string | Name of this receiver instance, will be shown on notifications. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)
3.  To simulate multiple instances of BambangShop Receiver (as the tutorial mandates you to do so),
    you can open new terminal, then edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` file, then execute another `cargo run`.

    For example, if you want to run 3 (three) instances of BambangShop Receiver at port `8001`, `8002`, and `8003`, you can do these steps:
    -   Edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8001`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8002`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open another new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8003`, then execute `cargo run`.

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Subscriber) Reflections

#### Reflection Subscriber-1

>In this tutorial, we used RwLock<> to synchronise the use of Vec of Notifications. Explain why it is necessary for this case, and explain why we do not use Mutex<> instead?

We use ```RwLock<>``` instead of ```Mutex<>``` because the ```Vec``` of Notifications is read frequently but written to only occasionally. ```RwLock<>``` allows multiple threads to read simultaneously while ensuring exclusive access for writes, making it more efficient than ```Mutex<>```, which locks access for both reading and writing. Using ```Mutex<>``` would unnecessarily block all threads on any operation, reducing concurrency and performance.

>In this tutorial, we used lazy_static external library to define Vec and DashMap as a “static” variable. Compared to Java where we can mutate the content of a static variable via a static function, why did not Rust allow us to do so?

Rust does not allow direct mutation of static variables because it is not thread-safe. Unlike Java, where static variables can be modified via static functions, Rust enforces immutability to prevent data races in multi-threaded programs. ```lazy_static``` helps define static variables safely, ensuring controlled access while maintaining thread safety.

#### Reflection Subscriber-2

>Have you explored things outside of the steps in the tutorial, for example: src/lib.rs? If not, explain why you did not do so. If yes, explain things that you have learned from those other parts of code.

Yes, I've extended the tutorial steps. In ```src/lib.rs```, I found data loading support functions from ```.env``` files and custom error handling. The file also initializes the Rocket app, defining static reqwest client and app settings instances for global use. Also, I researched ```RwLock``` and ```DashMap``` documentation—```RwLock``` allows multiple readers or a single writer at a time, while ```DashMap``` allows concurrent reads and writes efficiently. In ```main.rs```, the Rocket framework initializes the web server, manages application state, and defines routes for request processing.

>Since you have completed the tutorial by now and have tried to test your notification system by spawning multiple instances of Receiver, explain how Observer pattern eases you to plug in more subscribers. How about spawning more than one instance of Main app, will it still be easy enough to add to the system?

The Observer pattern makes it easy to add new subscribers without modifying the publisher, as subscribers register independently and the publisher only needs to notify them. This keeps the system flexible and scalable. However, spawning multiple instances of the main app can introduce challenges. If different publishers exist, ensuring all subscribers receive the correct updates may require additional logic to manage notification consistency across instances.

>Have you tried to make your own Tests, or enhance documentation on your Postman collection? If you have tried those features, tell us whether it is useful for your work (it can be your tutorial work or your Group Project).

Yes, I have added tests to the Postman collection to verify my endpoints, including multiple subscriptions and listening to different product types. This has been useful for ensuring the endpoints work as expected and return the correct data. Writing tests and enhancing documentation also help check code coverage, handle edge cases, and validate both happy and unhappy paths, improving the overall reliability of the system.
